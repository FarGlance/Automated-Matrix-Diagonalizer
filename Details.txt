We will use Flask with a javascript file and css file for separate files
    # We will store the javascript and css in static 
        # javascript is "script.js"
        # css is "style.css"
    
    # we will store the html in templates as "index.html"


Code Requirements
    # check if diagonalizable - is_diagonalizable

    # if diagonilizable get:
        #P it is just the eigenvectors
        #D it is P^-1 A P 

    # if not:
        # Return false

    # The interface, GUI
        #Drop down box 2-5
        #Grid of boxes to enter
        #Solve Button
        # if diagonalizable:
            #Show P 
            #Show D
        # if not:
            # Just say not diagonalizable
